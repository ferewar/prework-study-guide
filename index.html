          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul> 
               <li> The head element contains information about the webpage </li>
               <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
               <li> The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
               <li> The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
               <li> The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
               <li> The meta element defines metadata such as the caracter, set, description, keywords, author and viewpoint.
                Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable
               </li>
               <li> Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <b>child elements</b>. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the <b> parent element</b> </li>
               <li> The body element is a semantic element</li>
               <li> Not all elements are semantic, such as "div" that creates a division in the page, or "span" that creates an inline division</li>
               <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing <b>tag</b>, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
           <ul>
            <li> There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
            <li> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file. </li>
            <li> When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a  "link" element placed in the HTML's "head"</li>
            <li> A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li> The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. </li>
            <li> When adding a style sheet the rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource. </li>
            <li> The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
            <li> Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

        <h2> Git</h2>

         <ul>
           <li> Git is a tool that allows developers and others use version control</li>
           <li> GitHub is one of many web interfaces for using Git</li>
           <li> Repository (repo) is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored</li>
           <li> Branch is a version of the repo that allows you to work without affecting other brances</li>
           <li>Fork is a new repo that inherits from a parent "upstream" repo</li>
           <li> Markdown (*.md) is a way to write content that converts plain text into formatted text.</li>
           <li> Commit changes - a saved record of a change made to a file within the repo</li>
           <li> Pull request (PR) is a request for changes made to a branch to be pulled into another branch</li>
           <li> Merge - after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site</li>
           <li> Git status: checks what branch we currently on
           <li> Git checkout -b  "branch name" creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
           <li> Git checkout main: returns you to the main branch</li>
           <li> git branch: list your branches
           <li> Git log: shows all commits in the current branchs history </li>
           <li> Git add -A :command to commit all files in the working branch</li>

        <h2> JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.</li>
            <li> In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
            <li> We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
            <li> JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
            <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. </li>
            <li> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
            <li>  In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. </li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
            <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
            <li>You must call a function by name in order to execute it. </li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
